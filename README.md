# LVQToolbox - A scikit-learn extensions

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rickvanveen/LVQToolbox.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/rickvanveen/LVQToolbox)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/rickvanveen/LVQToolbox/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/github/rickvanveen/LVQToolbox?branch=master)

Template based on: https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/project-template
Implementation based on: http://matlabserver.cs.rug.nl/gmlvqweb/web/

Current status: I am not doing anything with the sklearn build/testing stuff anymore. So that doesn't work. Should be added in the future again. The structure and code in the repository has undergone multiple design changes and is fairly consistent (hopefully), but not everywhere.
